# # students = ["Joanna, "David", "Deivid", "Other David", "Ethan"]
# #             #similar to saying for i in range(5) : print(students[i]

#Challenge 1
#First, use the input to ask the user to input a sentence. (Like the first and second part of the tip conculator.)
#Second, create/write a function that could help counting the words in the sentence. (Remember to use string.)

X = input("Type here=")
